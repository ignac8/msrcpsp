There are multiple ways to run this project:

## Web
You can just go to [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ignac8/msrcpsp/master?filepath=docs%2Fds.ipynb) 

## Docker
You need to have the following requirements installed:
* Docker
* Docker Compose

Then you can run `run-docker.bat` file or corresponding scripts in your console

This should print 127.0.0.1 like url in console that need to be copied to browser

## Local
You need to have the following requirements installed:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Java 16
* IJava
* Maven 3

Then you can run `run-local.bat` file or corresponding scripts in your console

This should run browser opened on the notebook
